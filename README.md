WeCare comes as a solution to provide an integrated application with the following features:

This will make them feel that they are not alone, connect them to like minded people and hence they would feel less anxious.

2. **Content recommendations** (Music, articles, movies, news, etc.) - To keep their mind busy in this difficult situations.

3. **ToDo list and calendar** - A person has a lot in his mind, this feature will help one to schedule everything properly and efficiently. One could mark the important dates in the calendar and it will give you a prior notification about the same.

We have majorly using **flask framework**, **google firebase** , **socket.io** and **javascript** to make our website. For group chats, we would be using flask and use sockets for the messages and for to-do list and calendar, we would be using firebase to store the data and javascript and css for the design part. Rest of the features wonâ€™t require a database, thus only javascript would be majorly required.
